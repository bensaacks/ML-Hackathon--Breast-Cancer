# ML-Hackathon--Breast-Cancer
A project I have done as a part of a team of 4, as part of Machine Learning Hackathon in the Hebrew University, Jerusalem. 
Based on data of breast cancer patients treated in Israel over the last years, We tried to predict certain medical characteristics of the disease for each patient based on their available data.
The medical characteristics We tried to predict are:
1. metastases sites
2. diagnosed tumor size
